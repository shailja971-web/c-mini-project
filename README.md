How the Game Works

The program sets a fixed secret number.

The user is given a limited number of attempts to guess the number.

After each guess:

If the guess is correct, the user wins.

If the guess is too low, a hint is displayed.

If the guess is too high, a hint is displayed.

If the user fails to guess the number within the allowed attempts, the game ends and the secret number is revealed.
